   <!--We'll begin by thinking about the mode of seeing and the medium of photography. Seeing is just one way we come to understand our world. And when we use tools for seeing, like telescopes and microscopes, we can sometimes see an object differently from how we might otherwise. Sometimes we can bring the object closer, sometimes we can better frame the object, and sometimes we can bring different elements into focus. In this exercise we are going to think about how we can frame not the whole of the tree, but the branch, not the boulder, but the moss on its northern-most side. We might be in a big place, but we can use the lens to direct our attention to something smaller. So what are the parts that make up the whole of this system?-->

  <!--In this exercise we'll need to place our image assets in the project folder making sure each image is a .jpg or .png. Link the img src=to your image in your project folder. Keep thumbnails small (300pixels wide). You'll next need to scroll down to the corresponding modals at the bottom of this document to add the a full size image there as well. The modal will pop-up when the audience activates the link. Finally, be sure to add an alt= description for visually impaired audiences.-->

  <p>We found the dead bird on the trail during our hike. We were informed by our guide, Ranger Merna, that it was most likely killed by a stray cat or outdoor cat. The second image was taken to show what the trail looked like. The third is a close-up of a wild raspberry vine.</p>

         <!--It's time to switch to a different mode, to that of listening. Let's think about sounds we might be able to capture in our nature study. This could be wind blowing, birds chirping, footsteps trudging, water rolling...what do you hear that you can share with your audience. Often audio gets recorded as .wav files and it's then converted into mp4s which are much smaller and lower quality, but easier to embed in websites. Place the files in the music folder and label them to match your code.-->
